            <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Hello! I'm Yaswanth Narayana — a mechanical engineer, researcher, and systems thinker with a deep curiosity for how things work and how they can work better. My journey has taken me through hands-on engineering, product design, academic research, and technical problem solving — often at the intersection of mechanical systems, design optimization, and automation.
</p>

<p>
I’ve worked on projects ranging from flapping-wing micro air vehicles to industrial-scale inkjet printers, and from compliant mechanisms to stair-navigating robots (for which I hold a patent). In each experience, I’ve focused not just on solving problems, but on understanding the root causes and improving systems in elegant, cost-effective ways. I take pride in blending hands-on engineering skills with a design-first mindset.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I work as a Field Service Engineer in the U.S., where I support complex machinery, lead installations, and design custom components to improve system reliability. My goal is to continue building meaningful products and tools that serve people and solve real-world challenges — especially in sustainable technology and future-forward design.
</p>

<p>
Beyond engineering, I am deeply interested in physics-based AI, ethical technology, and the art of interdisciplinary problem-solving. I see myself as a builder, a learner, and a thinker — someone who values both precision and purpose. Whether you’re a recruiter, a researcher, or a fellow builder, I invite you to explore my work and connect.
