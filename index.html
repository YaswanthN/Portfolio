            <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Hi! I'm Yaswanth Narayana — a mechanical engineer driven by curiosity, creativity, and a passion for solving real-world problems. I specialize in designing intelligent systems that combine physics, mechanics, and emerging technologies to shape the future of engineering.
</p>

<p>
My experience spans from research in bio-inspired robotics and compliant mechanisms to developing custom mechanical solutions for complex electromechanical systems. I enjoy working hands-on — building, testing, optimizing — and thrive in environments where ideas quickly turn into prototypes.
</p>

<p>
I’m especially drawn to fields like robotics, autonomous systems, aerospace, and AI-powered design — where first-principles thinking meets innovation. I see engineering as a creative act, not just technical execution, and I constantly seek opportunities to learn, build, and make meaningful impact.
</p>

<p>
Whether it's contributing to mission-driven teams or pursuing bold ideas, I bring a problem-solving mindset, design intuition, and a relentless drive to push boundaries. Feel free to explore my projects — and reach out if you’re building something exciting.
</p>
